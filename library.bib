abstract = {We describe a novel approach to modeling idiosyncratic prosodic behavior for automatic speaker recognition. The approach computes various duration, pitch, and energy features for each estimated syllable in speech recognition output, quantizes the features, forms N-grams of the quantized values, and models normalized counts for each feature N-gram using support vector machines (SVMs). We refer to these features as “SNERF-grams” (N-grams of Syllable-based Nonuniform Extraction Region Features). Evaluation of SNERF-gram performance is conducted on two-party spontaneous English conversational telephone data from the Fisher corpus, using one conversation side in both training and testing. Results show that SNERF-grams provide significant performance gains when combined with a state-of-the-art baseline system, as well as with two highly successful long-range feature systems that capture word usage and lexically constrained duration patterns. Further experiments examine the relative contributions of features by quantization resolution, N-gram length, and feature type. Results show that the optimal number of bins depends on both feature type and N-gram length, but is roughly in the range of 5–10 bins. We find that longer N-grams are better than shorter ones, and that pitch features are most useful, followed by duration and energy features. The most important pitch features are those capturing pitch level, whereas the most important energy features reflect patterns of rising and falling. For duration features, nucleus duration is more important for speaker recognition than are durations from the onset or coda of a syllable. Overall, we find that SVM modeling of prosodic feature sequences yields valuable information for automatic speaker recognition. It also offers rich new opportunities for exploring how speakers differ from each other in voluntary but habitual ways.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present study is to assess the contribution of various phonetic and phonological factors to the perception of global foreign accent. Two native Spanish speakers of fluent but heavily accented English recorded English phrases containing sounds or sequences of sounds whose production is characteristically difficult for native speakers of Spanish. Investigated factors included: those affecting syllable structure (initial epenthetic schwa, non-initial epenthetic schwa (-ed ending)); those affecting vowel quality (vowel reduction, tense-laxness); those affecting consonants (final /s/ deletion, manner (/t∫−∫/), fricative voicing (/z-s/), stop voicing); and those affecting stress (lexical stress and phrasal stress). English-speaking listeners rated extent of foreign accent of the Spanish phrases as originally produced and as edited acoustically. Listeners were sensitive to syllable structure factors, final /s/ deletion, consonant manner, and lexical and phrasal stress, but were not sensitive to voicing differences.},

abstract = {Learners of a second language practice their pronunciation by listening to and imitating utterances from native speakers. Recent research has shown that choosing a well-matched native speaker to imitate can have a positive impact on pronunciation training. Here we propose a voice-transformation technique that can be used to generate the (arguably) ideal voice to imitate: the own voice of the learner with a native accent. Our work extends previous research, which suggests that providing learners with prosodically corrected versions of their utterances can be a suitable form of feedback in computer assisted pronunciation training. Our technique provides a conversion of both prosodic and segmental characteristics by means of a pitch-synchronous decomposition of speech into glottal excitation and spectral envelope. We apply the technique to a corpus containing parallel recordings of foreign-accented and native-accented utterances, and validate the resulting accent conversions through a series of perceptual experiments. Our results indicate that the technique can reduce foreign accentedness without significantly altering the voice quality properties of the foreign speaker. Finally, we propose a pedagogical strategy for integrating accent conversion as a form of behavioral shaping in computer assisted pronunciation training.},

abstract = {We explored a database covering seven dialects of British and Irish English and three different styles of speech to find acoustic correlates of prominence. We built classifiers, trained the classifiers on human prominence/non-prominence judgements, and then evaluated how well they behaved. The classifiers operate on 452 ms windows centered on syl- lables, using different acoustic measures. By comparing the performance of classifiers based on different measures, we can learn how prominence is expressed in speech. Contrary to textbooks and common assumption, fundamental frequency (f0) played a minor role in distinguishing promi- nent syllables from the rest of the utterance. Instead, speakers primarily marked prominence with patterns of loudness and duration. Two other acoustic measures that we examined also played a minor role, compara- ble to f0. All dialects and speaking styles studied here share a common definition of prominence. The result is robust to differences in labeling practice and the dialect of the labeler.},

abstract = {Reading fluency has traditionally focused on speed and accuracy yet recent reports suggest that expressive oral reading is an important component that has been largely overlooked. The current study assessed the impact of augmenting text with visual prosodic cues to improve expressive reading in beginning readers. Customized reading software was developed to present text augmented with prosodic cues to convey changes in pitch, duration and/or intensity. Prosodic modulation was derived from the recordings of a fluent adult model and rendered as a set of visual cues that could be presented in isolation or in combination. To establish baseline measures, eight children aged 7–8 first read a five-chapter story in standard text format. In the subsequent three sessions, participants were trained to use each augmented text cue with the guidance of an auditory model. They also had the opportunity to practice reading aloud in each cue condition. At the post-training session, participants re-recorded the baseline story with each chapter read in one of the different cue conditions (standard, pitch, duration, intensity and combination). Post-training and baseline recordings were acoustically analyzed to assess changes in reading expressivity. Despite large individual differences in how each participant implemented the prosodic cues, as a group, there were notable improvements in marking pitch accents and elongating word duration to convey linguistic contrasts. In fact, even after only three training sessions, participants appeared to have generalized implementation of pitch and word duration cues when reading standard text at post-training. In contrast, while participants manipulated pause duration when provided with explicit visual cues, they did not transfer these cues to standard text at post-training. These findings suggest that beginning readers could benefit from explicit visual prosodic cues and that even limited exposure may be sufficient to learn and generalize skills. Further discussion focuses on the implications of this work on struggling readers and second language learners.},

We describe the architecture of the system paying particular attention to the rationale behind it, to the performance of the error detection algorithm and its relationship to the effectiveness of the corrective feedback provided. It appears that although the system does not achieve 100\% accuracy in error detection, learners enjoy using it and the feedback provided is still effective in improving pronunciation errors after only a few hours of use over a period of one month. We discuss which factors may have led to these positive results and argue that it is worthwhile studying how ASR technology could be applied to the training of other speaking skills.},

@incollection{Vaissiere1991,
abstract = {This article concerns French rhythm. Rhythm (repetition and alternation of similar or opposite patterns) may be perceived at three different levels: the breath group (or intonation group), the prosodic word and the syllable. The breath group level (or intonation group) consists in the repetition and alternation of two highly contrastive global tunes, which resembles Jones' Tune 1 and Tune 2 for English, but the differences between the rising or falling tunes are extremely exaggerated in French. The second level concerns the repetition of an archetypal prosodic word (PW) rising pattern. A PW is composed of one or more lexical words. For a given rhythm, the speaker tends to utter PWs of similar length, regrouping, if necessary, short lexical words in a single PW. The up and down of Fo in French are bounded to boundaries. they are bounded to lexical stresses in English. The last level is characterized by the repetition of open syllables (3/4 of the syllables are open, and half are of CV type). Based on Fraisse's work on “intensive” (with initial accentuation) and “temporal” (with final lengthening) rhythmization, it is concluded that both types of rhythms, intensive and temporal, coexist in French and English; Accentuation (on lexically stressed syllable) is dominant in English (intensive rhythm), and (final) lengthening recessive. In French, temporal rhythm is dominant, but initial accentuation coexists and may prevail in some styles. It is concluded that, if English is interpreted as a “stress language”, French should be considered as a “boundary language”. The notion of “boundary” is cognitively more present in French than the notion of “stress”.},

abstract = {This article analyzes the detection of incorrect entries of nonnative speech in the context of foreign language learning. The purpose is to detect and reject incorrect entries (i.e. those for which the speech signal does not correspond at all to the associated text) while being tolerant to the mispronunciations of non-native speech. The proposed approach exploits the comparison between two text-to-speech alignments : one constrained by the text which is being checked, with another one unconstrained, corresponding to a phonetic decoding. Several comparison criteria are described and combined via a logistic regression function. The article analyzes the influence of different settings, such as the impact of non-native pronunciation variants, the impact of learning the decision functions on native or on non-native speech, as well as the impact of combining various comparison criteria. The performance evaluations are conducted both on native and on non-native speech.},

abstract = {Empirical studies are essential to improving our understanding of the relationship between accent and pronunciation teaching. However, the study of pronunciation has been marginalized within the field of applied linguistics. As a result, teachers are often left to rely on their own intuitions with little direction. Although some instructors can successfully assist their students under these conditions, many others are reluctant to teach pronunciation. In this article we call for more research to enhance our knowledge of the nature of foreign accents and their effects on communication. Research of this type has much to offer to teachers and students in terms of helping them to set learning goals, identifying appropriate pedagogical priorities for the classroom, and determining the most effective approaches to teaching. We discuss these possibilities within a framework in which mutual intelligibility is the primary consideration, although social ramifications of accent must also be taken into account. We describe several problem areas and identify some misconceptions about pronunciation instruction. In addition, we make suggestions for future research that would address intelligibility, functional load, computer-assisted language learning, and the role of the listener. Finally, we recommend greater collaboration between researchers and practitioners, such that more classroom-relevant research is undertaken.},

@article{Hagen2007,
abstract = {Speech technology offers great promise in the field of automated literacy and reading tutors for children. In such applications speech recognition can be used to track the reading position of the child, detect oral reading miscues, assessing comprehension of the text being read by estimating if the prosodic structure of the speech is appropriate to the discourse structure of the story, or by engaging the child in interactive dialogs to assess and train comprehension. Despite such promises, speech recognition systems exhibit higher error rates for children due to variabilities in vocal tract length, formant frequency, pronunciation, and grammar. In the context of recognizing speech while children are reading out loud, these problems are compounded by speech production behaviors affected by difficulties in recognizing printed words that cause pauses, repeated syllables and other phenomena. To overcome these challenges, we present advances in speech recognition that improve accuracy and modeling capability in the context of an interactive literacy tutor for children. Specifically, this paper focuses on a novel set of speech recognition techniques which can be applied to improve oral reading recognition. First, we demonstrate that speech recognition error rates for interactive read aloud can be reduced by more than 50\% through a combination of advances in both statistical language and acoustic modeling. Next, we propose extending our baseline system by introducing a novel token-passing search architecture targeting subword unit based speech recognition. The proposed subword unit based speech recognition framework is shown to provide equivalent accuracy to a whole-word based speech recognizer while enabling detection of oral reading events and finer grained speech analysis during recognition. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated using data collected from children in grades 3–5, namely 34.6\% of partial words with reasonable evidence in the speech signal are detected at a low false alarm rate of 0.5\%.},

We used na\"{\i}ve and experienced native speaker ratings of comprehensibility and nativeness to establish the key features affecting comprehensibility of the utterances of a group of Chinese learners of English. Native speaker raters assessed the comprehensibility of recorded utterances, pinpointed areas of difficulty and then rated for nativeness the same utterances, but after segmental information had been filtered out. The results show that prosodic information is important for comprehensibility, and that there are no significant differences between na\"{\i}ve and experienced raters on either comprehensibility or nativeness judgements. This suggests that na\"{\i}ve judgements are a useful and accessible source of data for identifying the parameters to be used in setting up automated feedback.},

abstract = {Technology based speech therapy systems are severely handicapped due to the absence of accurate prosodic event identification algorithms. This paper introduces an automatic method for the classification of strong-weak (SW) and weak-strong (WS) stress patterns in children speech with American English accent, for use in the assessment of the speech dysprosody. We investigate the ability of two sets of features used to train classifiers to identify the variation in lexical stress between two consecutive syllables. The first set consists of traditional features derived from measurements of pitch, intensity and duration, whereas the second set consists of energies of different filter banks. Three different classifiers were used in the experiments: an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier with a single hidden layer, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with both linear and Gaussian kernels and the Maximum Entropy modeling (MaxEnt). these features. Best results were obtained using an ANN classifier and a combination of the two sets of features. The system correctly classified 94\% of the SW stress patterns and 76\% of the WS stress patterns.},

We describe the use of semantic relatedness to select the next conversational fragment that an agent utters, to maximise dialogue coherence or to possibly suggest new directions for a dialogue. We compare our approach, using a specfic semantic relatedness metric, to an existing nearest-context mechanism based on T F x IDF for selecting fragments to continue a conversation. Evaluation with human judges shows that use of semantic relatedness provides improved coherence across a sample collection of generated conversations.},

@article{Dupoux1997,
abstract = {Spanish but not French uses accent to distinguish between words (e.g., t\'{o}po vs top\'{o}). Two populations of subjects were tested on the same materials to determine whether this difference has an impact on the perceptual capacities of listeners. In Experiment 1, using an ABX paradigm, we found that French subjects had significantly more difficulties than Spanish subjects in performing an ABX classification task based on accent. In Experiment 2, we found that Spanish subjects were unable to ignore irrelevant differences in accent in a phoneme-based ABX task, whereas French subjects had no difficulty at all. In Experiment 3, we replicated the basic French finding and found that Spanish subjects benefited from redundant accent information even when phonemic information alone was sufficient to perform the task. In our final experiment, we showed that French subjects can be made to respond to the acoustic correlates of accent; therefore their difficulty in Experiment 1 seems to be located at the level of short-term memory. The implications of these findings for language-specific processing and acquisition are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the quality of the automatic phonetic segmentation of non-native speech with respect to the amount of pronunciation variants that are used in the pronunciation lexicon, in view of exploiting such segmentation for providing automatic prosodic feedback for computer assisted foreign language learning. The selection of the pronunciation variants in the lexicon was controlled according to the amount of times the variants were observed in non-native speech from other speakers. Keeping all the variants that were observed at least one time in other non-native speaker data, leads to the worst results, confirming the fact that introducing unusual pronunciation variants in the lexicon is also harmful for non-native speech segmentation. Overall best results are obtained when keeping all the variants observed at least two times. This seems a good trade-off to have a large number of variants, and at the same time avoiding unusual variants.},
