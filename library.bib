abstract = {Empirical studies are essential to improving our understanding of the relationship between accent and pronunciation teaching. However, the study of pronunciation has been marginalized within the field of applied linguistics. As a result, teachers are often left to rely on their own intuitions with little direction. Although some instructors can successfully assist their students under these conditions, many others are reluctant to teach pronunciation. In this article we call for more research to enhance our knowledge of the nature of foreign accents and their effects on communication. Research of this type has much to offer to teachers and students in terms of helping them to set learning goals, identifying appropriate pedagogical priorities for the classroom, and determining the most effective approaches to teaching. We discuss these possibilities within a framework in which mutual intelligibility is the primary consideration, although social ramifications of accent must also be taken into account. We describe several problem areas and identify some misconceptions about pronunciation instruction. In addition, we make suggestions for future research that would address intelligibility, functional load, computer-assisted language learning, and the role of the listener. Finally, we recommend greater collaboration between researchers and practitioners, such that more classroom-relevant research is undertaken.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present study is to assess the contribution of various phonetic and phonological factors to the perception of global foreign accent. Two native Spanish speakers of fluent but heavily accented English recorded English phrases containing sounds or sequences of sounds whose production is characteristically difficult for native speakers of Spanish. Investigated factors included: those affecting syllable structure (initial epenthetic schwa, non-initial epenthetic schwa (-ed ending)); those affecting vowel quality (vowel reduction, tense-laxness); those affecting consonants (final /s/ deletion, manner (/t∫−∫/), fricative voicing (/z-s/), stop voicing); and those affecting stress (lexical stress and phrasal stress). English-speaking listeners rated extent of foreign accent of the Spanish phrases as originally produced and as edited acoustically. Listeners were sensitive to syllable structure factors, final /s/ deletion, consonant manner, and lexical and phrasal stress, but were not sensitive to voicing differences.},

@article{Shriberg2005,
abstract = {We describe a novel approach to modeling idiosyncratic prosodic behavior for automatic speaker recognition. The approach computes various duration, pitch, and energy features for each estimated syllable in speech recognition output, quantizes the features, forms N-grams of the quantized values, and models normalized counts for each feature N-gram using support vector machines (SVMs). We refer to these features as “SNERF-grams” (N-grams of Syllable-based Nonuniform Extraction Region Features). Evaluation of SNERF-gram performance is conducted on two-party spontaneous English conversational telephone data from the Fisher corpus, using one conversation side in both training and testing. Results show that SNERF-grams provide significant performance gains when combined with a state-of-the-art baseline system, as well as with two highly successful long-range feature systems that capture word usage and lexically constrained duration patterns. Further experiments examine the relative contributions of features by quantization resolution, N-gram length, and feature type. Results show that the optimal number of bins depends on both feature type and N-gram length, but is roughly in the range of 5–10 bins. We find that longer N-grams are better than shorter ones, and that pitch features are most useful, followed by duration and energy features. The most important pitch features are those capturing pitch level, whereas the most important energy features reflect patterns of rising and falling. For duration features, nucleus duration is more important for speaker recognition than are durations from the onset or coda of a syllable. Overall, we find that SVM modeling of prosodic feature sequences yields valuable information for automatic speaker recognition. It also offers rich new opportunities for exploring how speakers differ from each other in voluntary but habitual ways.},

abstract = {Technology based speech therapy systems are severely handicapped due to the absence of accurate prosodic event identification algorithms. This paper introduces an automatic method for the classification of strong-weak (SW) and weak-strong (WS) stress patterns in children speech with American English accent, for use in the assessment of the speech dysprosody. We investigate the ability of two sets of features used to train classifiers to identify the variation in lexical stress between two consecutive syllables. The first set consists of traditional features derived from measurements of pitch, intensity and duration, whereas the second set consists of energies of different filter banks. Three different classifiers were used in the experiments: an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier with a single hidden layer, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with both linear and Gaussian kernels and the Maximum Entropy modeling (MaxEnt). these features. Best results were obtained using an ANN classifier and a combination of the two sets of features. The system correctly classified 94\% of the SW stress patterns and 76\% of the WS stress patterns.},

abstract = {This article analyzes the detection of incorrect entries of nonnative speech in the context of foreign language learning. The purpose is to detect and reject incorrect entries (i.e. those for which the speech signal does not correspond at all to the associated text) while being tolerant to the mispronunciations of non-native speech. The proposed approach exploits the comparison between two text-to-speech alignments : one constrained by the text which is being checked, with another one unconstrained, corresponding to a phonetic decoding. Several comparison criteria are described and combined via a logistic regression function. The article analyzes the influence of different settings, such as the impact of non-native pronunciation variants, the impact of learning the decision functions on native or on non-native speech, as well as the impact of combining various comparison criteria. The performance evaluations are conducted both on native and on non-native speech.},

abstract = {In the context of a project developing software for pronunciation practice and feedback for Mandarin-speaking learners of English, a key issue is how to decide which features of pronunciation to focus on in giving feedback. We used na\"{\i}ve and experienced native speaker ratings of comprehensibility and nativeness to establish the key features affecting comprehensibility of the utterances of a group of Chinese learners of English. Native speaker raters assessed the comprehensibility of recorded utterances, pinpointed areas of difficulty and then rated for nativeness the same utterances, but after segmental information had been filtered out. The results show that prosodic information is important for comprehensibility, and that there are no significant differences between na\"{\i}ve and experienced raters on either comprehensibility or nativeness judgements. This suggests that na\"{\i}ve judgements are a useful and accessible source of data for identifying the parameters to be used in setting up automated feedback.},

@article{Hagen2007,
abstract = {Speech technology offers great promise in the field of automated literacy and reading tutors for children. In such applications speech recognition can be used to track the reading position of the child, detect oral reading miscues, assessing comprehension of the text being read by estimating if the prosodic structure of the speech is appropriate to the discourse structure of the story, or by engaging the child in interactive dialogs to assess and train comprehension. Despite such promises, speech recognition systems exhibit higher error rates for children due to variabilities in vocal tract length, formant frequency, pronunciation, and grammar. In the context of recognizing speech while children are reading out loud, these problems are compounded by speech production behaviors affected by difficulties in recognizing printed words that cause pauses, repeated syllables and other phenomena. To overcome these challenges, we present advances in speech recognition that improve accuracy and modeling capability in the context of an interactive literacy tutor for children. Specifically, this paper focuses on a novel set of speech recognition techniques which can be applied to improve oral reading recognition. First, we demonstrate that speech recognition error rates for interactive read aloud can be reduced by more than 50\% through a combination of advances in both statistical language and acoustic modeling. Next, we propose extending our baseline system by introducing a novel token-passing search architecture targeting subword unit based speech recognition. The proposed subword unit based speech recognition framework is shown to provide equivalent accuracy to a whole-word based speech recognizer while enabling detection of oral reading events and finer grained speech analysis during recognition. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated using data collected from children in grades 3–5, namely 34.6\% of partial words with reasonable evidence in the speech signal are detected at a low false alarm rate of 0.5\%.},

We describe the architecture of the system paying particular attention to the rationale behind it, to the performance of the error detection algorithm and its relationship to the effectiveness of the corrective feedback provided. It appears that although the system does not achieve 100\% accuracy in error detection, learners enjoy using it and the feedback provided is still effective in improving pronunciation errors after only a few hours of use over a period of one month. We discuss which factors may have led to these positive results and argue that it is worthwhile studying how ASR technology could be applied to the training of other speaking skills.},

abstract = {Spanish but not French uses accent to distinguish between words (e.g., t\'{o}po vs top\'{o}). Two populations of subjects were tested on the same materials to determine whether this difference has an impact on the perceptual capacities of listeners. In Experiment 1, using an ABX paradigm, we found that French subjects had significantly more difficulties than Spanish subjects in performing an ABX classification task based on accent. In Experiment 2, we found that Spanish subjects were unable to ignore irrelevant differences in accent in a phoneme-based ABX task, whereas French subjects had no difficulty at all. In Experiment 3, we replicated the basic French finding and found that Spanish subjects benefited from redundant accent information even when phonemic information alone was sufficient to perform the task. In our final experiment, we showed that French subjects can be made to respond to the acoustic correlates of accent; therefore their difficulty in Experiment 1 seems to be located at the level of short-term memory. The implications of these findings for language-specific processing and acquisition are discussed.},
