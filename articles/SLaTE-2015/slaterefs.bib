@article{Dupoux1997,
abstract = {Spanish but not French uses accent to distinguish between words (e.g., t\'{o}po vs top\'{o}). Two populations of subjects were tested on the same materials to determine whether this difference has an impact on the perceptual capacities of listeners. In Experiment 1, using an ABX paradigm, we found that French subjects had significantly more difficulties than Spanish subjects in performing an ABX classification task based on accent. In Experiment 2, we found that Spanish subjects were unable to ignore irrelevant differences in accent in a phoneme-based ABX task, whereas French subjects had no difficulty at all. In Experiment 3, we replicated the basic French finding and found that Spanish subjects benefited from redundant accent information even when phonemic information alone was sufficient to perform the task. In our final experiment, we showed that French subjects can be made to respond to the acoustic correlates of accent; therefore their difficulty in Experiment 1 seems to be located at the level of short-term memory. The implications of these findings for language-specific processing and acquisition are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents a general statistical methodology for the analysis of multivariate categorical data arising from observer reliability studies. The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.},

abstract = {Technology based speech therapy systems are severely handicapped due to the absence of accurate prosodic event identification algorithms. This paper introduces an automatic method for the classification of strong-weak (SW) and weak-strong (WS) stress patterns in children speech with American English accent, for use in the assessment of the speech dysprosody. We investigate the ability of two sets of features used to train classifiers to identify the variation in lexical stress between two consecutive syllables. The first set consists of traditional features derived from measurements of pitch, intensity and duration, whereas the second set consists of energies of different filter banks. Three different classifiers were used in the experiments: an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier with a single hidden layer, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with both linear and Gaussian kernels and the Maximum Entropy modeling (MaxEnt). these features. Best results were obtained using an ANN classifier and a combination of the two sets of features. The system correctly classified 94\% of the SW stress patterns and 76\% of the WS stress patterns.},
