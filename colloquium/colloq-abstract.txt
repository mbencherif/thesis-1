The prosodic realization of lexical stress, the phenomenon by which certain syllable(s) in a word are accentuated more than others, is an important feature of the German phonological system, but one that can pose a considerable challenge to students learning German as a foreign language (L2), especially students whose native language (L1) is French. This thesis investigates how Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) can help L1 French speakers improve their lexical stress prosody in German. It describes the manual annotation of lexical stress errors in a small learner speech corpus, investigates a variety of methods for automatically diagnosing such errors in learner word utterances, and explores how these diagnoses can be used to deliver diverse types of feedback to learners.  Its most important contribution is a prototype CAPT tool which integrates these various diagnostic and feedback methods via an easy-to-use web interface. This tool is designed not only to provide students with automatic, individualized feedback on their lexical stress errors, but also to facilitate future research on the efficacy of the different diagnostic and feedback approaches explored in this thesis.
