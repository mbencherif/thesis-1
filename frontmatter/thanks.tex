First of all, I am extremely grateful to my thesis supervisors at Saarland University, Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius and Dr. Jürgen Trouvain; this thesis could not have been written without their support, encouragement, and feedback.

The work reported in this thesis was partially supported by the Franco-German project \textit{Individualized Feedback for Computer-Assisted Spoken Language learning} (IFCASL), funded jointly by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR). I thank the the entire IFCASL research team at both Saarland University (Saarbrücken, Germany) and LORIA (Nancy, France) for giving me the opportunity to work with them on this project over the last two years, and for supporting my work at both institutions.

I would especially like to thank Dr. Anne Bonneau, Dr. Julie Busset, Dr. Vincent Colotte, Dr. Dominique Fohr, Dr. Odile Mella, and Dr. Yves Laprie at LORIA, who provided invaluable advice on prosody in Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CAPT), speech processing, and integration of the \textit{Jsnoori} software with the \textit{de-stress} system. I am also very grateful to Jeanin Jügler and Dr. Frank Zimmerer at Saarland University for all their help, especially with the lexical stress annotation project \TODO{and the German translation of the thesis abstract}. 

Many thanks also to \TODO{Marie Springinsfeld} for generously providing the French translation of the thesis abstract.

I would additionally like to thank the annotators (not named to preserve anonymity) who voluntarily participated in the lexical stress annotation project; without the error-annotated data resulting from their efforts, much of the work reported in this thesis would not have been possible.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to 
my mother, Eileen Julian, and to my wonderful friends in Saarbrücken and around the world.
%my friends and family, 
%especially Eileen Julian, James Newman, Max Rabkin, Rebecca Row, and Nat Ward, 
I could not have completed this thesis or the studies leading up to it without 
their moral support over the past months and years.
