In the field of second-language education, pronunciation has traditionally been given less attention than other areas such as grammar or vocabulary \citep{Derwing2005}. One reason for this may be that pronunciation is best taught through one-on-one instruction, which is not often possible in the traditional classroom setting. Hence the attraction of Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems, which have the potential to automatically provide highly individualized analysis of learner errors, and feedback on how to correct them and achieve more intelligible and native-like pronunciation in the target language \citep{Witt2012}. 

%Something about how there's not much CAPT for German?

For students with French as their first language (L1) who are learning German as a second language (L2), the sound system of the L2 can pose a variety of difficulties, one of the most important and interesting of which is the way in which certain syllables in German words are accentuated more than others, a phenomenon referred to as lexical stress. Learning to navigate German lexical stress is especially challenging for L1 French speakers, because this phenomenon is realized differently, or perhaps does not occur at all, in the French language. 

With these motivations in mind, this thesis project aims to advance the state of the art of German CAPT %TODO too intense? reword
by creating a tool which will diagnose and offer feedback on lexical stress errors in the L2 German speech of L1 French speakers, in the hopes of helping these learners become more sensitive to the lexical stress patterns of German and develop the ability to accurately realize these patterns in their speech.

\section{Context: The IFCASL project}
\label{sec:intro:ifcasl}

The work reported here has been conducted in the context of the ongoing research project ``Individualized Feedback in Computer-Assisted Spoken Language Learning (IFCASL)'' at the University of Saarland (Saarbrücken, Germany) and LORIA (Nancy, France). 
%TODO more info
%TODO can I cite project proposal?

The ultimate goal of the project is to take initial steps toward the development of a CAPT system targeting, on the one hand, native (L1) French speakers learning German as a foreign language (L2), and on the other, L1 German speakers learning French as their L2. To this end, a bidirectional learner speech corpus has been recorded, comprising phonetically diverse utterances in French and German spoken by both native speakers and non-native speakers with the other language as L1 \citep{Fauth2014,Trouvain2013}.  

This thesis will focus exclusively on French L1 speakers learning German as L2. The German-language subset of the IFCASL corpus will be instrumental in training and testing the automatic diagnosis and feedback systems which this work aims to develop. Futhermore, those systems will be designed with a view to contributing to the overall set of software developed in the context of the IFCASL project, such that they will be as compatible as possible with the other tools developed and used by the IFCASL team. %TODO reword that

The main objective of this work is to investigate the automatic treatment of lexical stress errors in the context of a CAPT system for French learners of German. This includes, on the one hand, an examination of the ways in which lexical stress errors of the type made by French L1 speakers when speaking German as L2 can be reliably detected and measured %TODO reword
automatically, and on the other, an exploration of the types of multimodal feedback on such errors that can be automatically delivered based on the aforementioned error detection.

The intented outcome of these investigations is a prototype CAPT tool, illustrated in \cref{fig:hourglass-ITS}, %TODO fix ref
which can diagnose lexical stress errors in different ways and present learners with different types of feedback on these errors, such that researchers can use this modular system to study the impact of various assessment and feedback types on learner outcomes, user engagement, and other factors impacting the success of a CAPT system.

Once more is known about which diagnosis/feedback types should be delivered to which learners in which situations, this tool could become a useful component to a fully-fledged CAPT system, in which learner models and other intelligent components automatically decide which modules of the tool to activate. %TODO figure(s)
