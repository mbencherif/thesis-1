\section{Prosodic analysis}
	``acoustic differences between stressed and unstressed syllables are relatively large in spontaneous speech. With laboratory-read materials, however, such differences do not always arise'' \citep[p.~275]{Cutler2005}

	\subsection{Pitch}
		``...in German utterances, stressed syllables could be signaled by any F0 obtrusion from the overall contour, so that a stressed syllable could be either higher or lower in pitch than its neighbors'' \citep[p.~267]{Cutler2005}
	\subsection{Duration}
	\subsection{Intensity}
		least important of the three \citep{Cutler2005}
